/*
* The preceding implementation works fine in the case of the single-threaded environment,
* but when it comes to multi-threaded systems, it can cause issues if multiple threads are inside
* the if condition at the same time. It will destroy the singleton pattern and both threads will get different
* instances of the singleton class.
* In the next section, we will see different ways to create a thread-safe singleton class.
